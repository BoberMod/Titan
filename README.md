Titan `/ˈtaɪtən/` is an advanced Counter-Strike Global Offensive report and commendation bot.
Its goal is to maintain a clean Matchmaking system by sending a target forcefully (by 11 reports) into Overwatch.
It provides a advanced set of features and high effiency when compared against other report and commendation bots.

## Features

* Support for both a graphical user interface (GUI) and command line.
* High performance thanks to multi-threaded reporting and commending (when compared to other report bots).
* Ban checking for both target and bot accounts. (Requires own generated [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) key)
* Integrated Sharecode parser that automaticly pauses the Match ID from a CS:GO Demo Share URL
* Automatic index timer which outputs when an account has finished its 6 hours cooldown.
* Cross-platform compatibility, supports both Windows and Linux. Darwin support is coming soon.
* No installation necessary, every release is provided as binary archives.
* Tracking of botted victims with automatic notification when a ban occurs.
* Automatic Steam Guard code generation from Shared Secrets
* Steam Guard support

                {
                    "username": "username1",
                    "password": "password1",
                    "enabled": true, // May be omitted if you want set it to default value (true)
                    "sentry": false, // May be omitted if you want set it to default value (false)
                    "secret": "Shared Secret for SteamGuard" // May be omitted if you don't want to use the shared secret generator
                },
                {
                    "username": "username11",
                    "password": "password11",

                    "secret": "Shared Secret for SteamGuard" // May be omitted if you don't want to use the shared secret generator
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "accounts": [
                {
                    "username": "username12",
                    "password": "password12",
                    "enabled": true, // May be omitted if you want set it to default value (true)
                    "sentry": false, // May be omitted if you want set it to default value (false)
                    "secret": "Shared Secret for SteamGuard" // May be omitted if you don't want to use the shared secret generator
                },
                {
                    "username": "username22",
                    "password": "password22",
                    "enabled": true, // May be omitted if you want set it to default value (true)
                    "sentry": false, // May be omitted if you want set it to default value (false)
                    "secret": "Shared Secret for SteamGuard" // May be omitted if you don't want to use the shared secret generator
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
#### Start
Run the program from command line with the following syntax:

```bash
$ mono Titan.exe (--target) (--mode) [--id] [--file]
```

On Windows, run Titan without the `mono` part at the beginning.

If no arguments have been passed with Titan, the GUI will open:

If one of your recently botted players got banned, you'll also receive a notification:

## Benchmarks

Titan is a multi-threaded C# report bot for Counter-Strike Global Offensive.
Because Titan is multi-threaded, it obviously has an advantage when comparing it to other report bots,
which are mostly one-threaded and written in JavaScript using Node.js.

Benchmarks will follow soon.
